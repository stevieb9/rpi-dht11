Revision history for Perl extension RPi::DHT11

0.07_03 2016-09-01
        - GPIO pin mode is enforced
        - add ability to share pin modes with RPi::WiringPi seamlessly
        - we can now be setup() before, or after RPi::WiringPi, we'll share the
          pin mode whoever set up first

0.07_02 2016-09-01
        - POD fixes and updates
        - separated C functionality into its own POD doc

0.07_01 2016-09-01
        - clone of RPi::DHT11::EnvControl with reduced functionality, as that
          module shouldn't do anything more than read the sensor (the said
          distribution will be removed from CPAN)
        - removed all code that was outside of core read functionality
        - simplified new() to accept a single integer pin number param
        - modified temp() and humidity() to keep polling if the result is zero
        - variable renaming

0.06    2016-08-12
        - POD updates
        - c_temp() now returns an int for both temperature and humidity. The
          temperature is returned as Celcius
        - if 'f' is sent in as a single param to Perl's temp() function, it'll
          return the temp in Farenheit. Otherwise, by default, we return
          Celcius
        - changed return type of temp() and humidity() to be ints

0.05    2016-08-09
        - added test files to MANIFEST
        - updated examples/synopsis.pl with complete working example

0.04    2016-08-09
        - moved from functional interface to OO for keeping state and
          better error management
        - temp() now returns a 2 point float

0.03    2016-08-09
        - added status() which checks the status of a GPIO pin, and removed
          that functionality from control()

0.02    2016-08-09
        - added temp(), humidity(), control(), cleanup() public functions
        - added noboard_test() private function
        - functionality for testing on a non Pi board implemented
        - added initial test suite
