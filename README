NAME

    RPi::DHT11 - Fetch the temperature/humidity from the DHT11 hygrometer
    sensor on Raspberry Pi

SYNOPSIS

        use RPi::DHT11;
    
        my $pin = 26;
    
        my $env = RPi::DHT11->new($pin);
    
        my $temp     = $env->temp;
        my $humidity = $env->humidity;

DESCRIPTION

    This module is an interface to the DHT11 temperature/humidity sensor
    when connected to a Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.

    Due to the near-realtime access requirements of reading the input pin
    of the sensor, the core of this module is written in XS (C).

    This module requires the wiringPi <http://wiringpi.com/> library to be
    installed, and uses WiringPi's GPIO pin numbering scheme (see gpio
    readall at the command line).

METHODS

 new($pin)

    Parameters:

        $pin

    Mandatory. Pin number for the DHT11 sensor's DATA pin (values are
    0-40).

 temp('f')

    Fetches the current temperature.

    Returns an integer of the temperature, in celcius by default.

    Parameters:

        'f'

    Optional: Send in the string char 'f' to receive the temp in Farenheit.

 humidity

    Fetches the current humidity.

    Returns the humidity as either an integer of the current humidity
    level.

 cleanup

    Returns the pin back to default state if it's not already. Called
    automatically by DESTROY().

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    There are a couple of env vars to help prototype and run unit tests
    when not on a RPi board.

 RDE_HAS_BOARD

    Set to 1 to tell the unit test runner that we're on a Pi.

 RDE_NOBOARD_TEST

    Set to 1 to tell the system we're not on a Pi. Most methods/functions
    will return default (ie. non-live) data when in this mode.
